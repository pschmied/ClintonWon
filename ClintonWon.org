People [[http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/08/31/poll-clinton-trump-most-unfavorable-candidates-ever/89644296/][really, really didn't like either of the candidates this
election]]. But, based on election results, it seems likely that [[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/us-election-hillary-clinton-more-votes-popular-vote-any-candidate-barack-obama-donald-trump-a7413596.html][more
people preferred Hillary Clinton to Donald Trump]]. One NY Times
analyst, Nate Cohn, is forecasting the final popular vote as [[https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/796409592708268038][Clinton
receiving 63.4 million votes to Donald Trump's 61.2 million]].

I for one am not putting a lot of faith in NY Times analyst forecasts
right at the moment. So let's just look at the votes cast so
far. David Wasserman at Cook Political Report has [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/133Eb4qQmOxNvtesw2hdVns073R68EZx4SfCnP4IGQf8/htmlview][compiled official
vote tallies in a spreadsheet]]. As of this writing, those tallies put
Clinton ahead by over 2 million votes. I wanted to put these figures
in context because I, [[http://www.latimes.com/opinion/readersreact/la-ol-le-electoral-college-trump-20161112-story.html][like Donald Trump, am inclined to agree that the
Electoral College is a "disaster for democracy]]."

Because I am a nerd, this whole piece is coded up transparently in [[https://www.r-project.org/][R]]/ 
[[http://orgmode.org/][Emacs org-mode]] and can be re-run once all the votes are tallied and we
have a final margin of popular victory / loss for the two
candidates.

* Assumed popular vote tallies / margin of victory
Let's start with what we pretend we know: popular vote tallies. 

#+NAME: margin-of-victory
#+BEGIN_SRC R :results var :exports code
  library(tidyverse)                      # We'll need these later
  library(ggthemes)
  library(scales)

  vote_tallies_url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/133Eb4qQmOxNvtesw2hdVns073R68EZx4SfCnP4IGQf8/export?format=csv&id=133Eb4qQmOxNvtesw2hdVns073R68EZx4SfCnP4IGQf8&gid=19"

  vote_tallies_df <- read_csv(url(vote_tallies_url), skip=4) %>%
      filter(State == "U.S. Total")

  voted_hillary <- vote_tallies_df$`Clinton (D)`
  voted_donald  <- vote_tallies_df$`Trump (R)`

  ## Even Fox News is projecting a popular vote victory for Clinton, so
  ## I think it's safe to assume these won't flip.
  (hillary_victory_margin <- voted_hillary - voted_donald)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS: margin-of-victory
: 2126077


So there we have it, a margin of victory of call_margin-of-victory() for Clinton.


* Comparison to 25 largest U.S. cities
To see how Clinton's margin of victory compares to the population of
major U.S. cities, I pulled the city populations from the Census's
2015 population estimates[fn::American Community Survey

If we were to pit the cities of the United States against Hillary's
popular vote balance, it wouldn't even be a contest. Only the top
src_R[:results val]{nrow(city_pop[city_pop$Population > hillary_victory_margin, ])} cities are in the same league. 

* Comparison to U.S. states

As we saw in the last section, Hillary's popular vote win was larger
than the vast majority of U.S. cities. What if we compare it to states'
populations? What about population of eligible voters?

To answer this, I once again pulled 2015 population estimates from the
Census ACS, this time using the 1 year estimates.[fn::American
Community Survey
http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_15_1YR_B01003&prodType=table
accessed 13 November 2016] For eligible voters,
I grabbed figures from the United States Elections Project at the
University of Florida.[fn::McDonald, Michael P. 2016. "2016 November General Election : Turnout Rates"
